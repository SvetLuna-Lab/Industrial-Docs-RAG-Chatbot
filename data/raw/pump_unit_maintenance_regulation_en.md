# Maintenance Regulation for Pump Unit N-250

Document: draft maintenance regulation.  
Object: pump unit N-250 (crude oil / petroleum products transfer).  
Purpose: ensure reliable and safe operation of the unit under industrial conditions.

## 1. General Provisions

1. This regulation applies to pump units of type N-250 installed at booster pump stations PS-1 and PS-2.
2. Maintenance is performed by personnel who have completed training and passed safety knowledge checks according to applicable regulations.

## 2. Maintenance Periodicity

- Shift inspection — before each unit start.
- Planned maintenance (PM-1) — at least once per month.
- Extended maintenance (PM-2) — at least once per quarter.
- Unscheduled inspection — upon detection of deviations (vibration, noise, leaks).

## 3. Shift Inspection

Before starting the unit, the operator must:

1. Visually check:
   - absence of product and oil leaks;
   - condition of flanged connections;
   - absence of foreign objects near rotating parts.
2. Check instrumentation readings:
   - suction pressure;
   - discharge pressure;
   - bearing temperature (via sensors, if installed).
3. Verify the position of shut-off valves according to the process flow diagram.

Inspection results are recorded in the shift log.

## 4. Planned Maintenance (PM-1)

At least once per month:

1. Check the level and condition of bearing lubrication:
   - top up or change oil according to the lubrication chart.
2. Check tightening of fastening elements:
   - foundation bolts;
   - motor mounting bolts;
   - guards and covers.
3. Check unit vibration based on installed vibration sensors and/or portable vibrometer readings.
4. Clean the unit from dust, dirt, and product spills.

If deviations are found, the operator informs the shift supervisor and initiates unscheduled repair.

## 5. Extended Maintenance (PM-2)

Quarterly (or based on operating hours specified in the unit manual):

1. Detailed inspection of seals is performed.
2. Shaft alignment between pump and motor is checked.
3. Vibration trend over the operation period is analyzed:
   - if vibration steadily exceeds acceptable levels, the unit must be taken out of service for repair.
4. Actual operating parameters (head, flow rate) are compared with design values.

## 6. Occupational Health and Safety Requirements

1. All work must be performed in accordance with applicable occupational health and industrial safety instructions.
2. Before maintenance, the unit must be:
   - stopped;
   - disconnected from power supply;
   - locked out to prevent unintentional start (lockout/tagout).
3. Work is prohibited if:
   - combustible product leaks are present;
   - there are no measures taken to localize such leaks.

## 7. Documentation

1. All completed work must be recorded in the maintenance log.
2. After each PM-2, a short report must be prepared, including:
   - detected defects;
   - actions taken;
   - recommendations for further operation.
